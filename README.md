# Data Visualization Techniques

This repository explores various data visualization techniques to gain insights and understand datasets effectively. Currently, it covers two fundamental techniques:

1. **Understanding Data with Descriptive Statistics**
2. **Understanding Data with Visualization**

## 1. Understanding Data with Descriptive Statistics

Descriptive statistics provide a summary of important aspects of a dataset, helping to understand its central tendency, variability, and distribution. This technique involves calculating measures such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and quartiles to describe the characteristics of the data.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Mean, Median, and Mode
- Measures of Variability: Range, Variance, and Standard Deviation
- Measures of Distribution: Quartiles, Interquartile Range (IQR)
- Skewness and Kurtosis
- Frequency Distributions

## 2. Understanding Data with Visualization

Data visualization involves representing data graphically to identify patterns, trends, and relationships within the dataset. This technique utilizes various types of charts, plots, and graphs to present data visually, making it easier to interpret and analyze.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Box Plots
- Histograms
- Whisker Plots
- Multivariate Plots
- Univariate Density Plots
- Line Graphs

## Usage

Each technique includes code examples and explanations to demonstrate how to implement it using popular data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. Follow the instructions provided in each section to understand and visualize your datasets effectively.

## Contributing

Contributions to expand this repository with additional data visualization techniques or improve existing content are welcome!
